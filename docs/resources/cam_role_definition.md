# visionone_cam_role_definition (Resource)

Trend Micro Vision One CAM Azure Role Definition resource. Creates a custom Azure role with the [necessary permissions](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-vision-one-azure-sub-required-permissions) for Vision One Cloud Account Management.

#### Note
Feature-based permission configuration will be implemented in a future release. Currently, all standard permissions are applied regardless of selected features.
Review the permissions required to deploy resources and the permissions granted during the terraform process, [Azure required and granted permissions](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-vision-one-azure-sub-required-permissions)

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage (Single Subscription)

```terraform
resource "visionone_cam_role_definition" "cam_role_definition" {
  subscription_id = "11111111-1111-2222-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbb"
}
```

### Management Group Usage (Cross-Subscription Role Assignment)

```terraform
variable "all_subscription_ids" {
  type = list(string)
  default = [
    "11111111-1111-2222-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbb",  # Primary
    "00000000-1ea8-4822-b823-abcdefghijkl",  # Member 1
    "22222222-3333-4444-cccc-dddddddddddd"   # Member 2
  ]
}

resource "visionone_cam_role_definition" "primary" {
  subscription_id = var.all_subscription_ids[0]  # Created in primary subscription

  # Include all subscriptions in assignable_scopes to enable cross-subscription assignments
  assignable_scopes = toset([
    for sub_id in var.all_subscription_ids :
    "/subscriptions/${sub_id}"
  ])
}

# Now you can assign this role to ANY subscription in assignable_scopes
resource "visionone_cam_role_assignment" "members" {
  for_each = toset(slice(var.all_subscription_ids, 1, length(var.all_subscription_ids)))

  role_definition_id = visionone_cam_role_definition.primary.id
  principal_id       = "<service-principal-object-id>"
  subscription_id    = each.value  # Can assign to member subscriptions
}
```

### Example with Management Group Scope

```terraform
resource "visionone_cam_role_definition" "mgmt_group" {
  subscription_id = "11111111-1111-2222-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbb"

  # Use management group scope to cover all current and future subscriptions
  assignable_scopes = [
    "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/my-mgmt-group"
  ]
}
```

### Example Detailed Usage

}

resource "visionone_cam_role_definition" "cam_role_definition" {
